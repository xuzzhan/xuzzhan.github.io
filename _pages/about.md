Hi, I am xuzzhan. I am currently an MPhil student at Tongji University, and the expected graduation date is June 2024. This website is primarily used to share my research work and study notes. 

In my previous work, my research primarily focused on urban network resilience and spatio-temporal modeling, integrating methods from machine learning and statistics. As a researcher with a background in urban planning, I am dedicated to uncovering the underlying patterns within spatio-temporal big data and applying them to inform urban development policies. 

If you are interested in my experience, feel free to contact me via email at [xuzzhan@gmail.com](mailto:xuzzhan@gmail.com).

## Research interests
