Hi, I am xuzzhan.  During my master's studies, I was an MPhil student at Tongji University, under the guidance of Assoc. Prof. Shen Yao (Director of [TJ-CUSP](https://www.planningscience.cn/ )). This website is primarily used to share my research work and study notes. 

In my previous work, my research primarily focused on urban network resilience and spatio-temporal modeling, integrating methods from machine learning and statistics. As a researcher with a background in urban planning, I am dedicated to uncovering the underlying patterns within spatio-temporal big data and applying them to inform urban development policies. 

If you are interested in my experience, feel free to contact me via email at [xuzzhan@outlook.com](mailto:xuzzhan@outlook.com).
