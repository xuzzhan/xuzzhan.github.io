My name is Andy Jingqian Xue (ËñõÊôØË∞¶) and I am currently an MPhil student at <a href='https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/society-hub/urban-governance-and-design/'>Thrust of Urban Governance and Design </a> of <a href='https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/'>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)</a> under the guidance of <a href='http://livablecitylab.hkust-gz.edu.cn/binjiang/'>Prof. Bin Jiang</a>. Before that, I earned a BSc degree in geographic information science from <a href='https://gp.sysu.edu.cn/en/'>School of Geography and Planning </a> of <a href='https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/'>Sun Yat-sen University</a> with the mentorship of <a href='https://gp.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/2789'>Prof. Qian Shi</a> and <a href='https://gp.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/3352'>Prof. Da He</a>.

I am deeply interested in the fundamental properties and patterns of geographic features. Consequently, I have developed several GeoAI algorithms that enable models to better learn complex spatial patterns or the so-called spatial heterogeneity, thereby improving the accuracy and model explicability of land use mapping. I am also studying and researching quantitative approaches to modeling urban complexity and spatial patterns. I firmly believe and advocate that the problems of cities lie not only in understanding spatial complexity but also in creating organized complexity to make cities more livable and resilient.

In addition to GeoAI and urban complexity, I am also interested in big data analysis and visualization, human perceptions of urban environments, and urban health. If you are interested in my experiences, please feel free to reach out through <a href='andy.j.xue@hkust-gz.edu.cn'>andy.j.xue AT hkust-gz.edu.cn</a>.
